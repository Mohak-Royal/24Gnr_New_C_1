Loops:  repeating the same process multiple time until a specific condition is satisfied.


Advantages : 
-it provides code reusability
-we do not need to write the same code again and again
-we can traverse over the elements of the data structures like array ...


Types of Loops in C:

1. For Loop
2. While loop
3. do while loop





For Loop : 
-for loop is used to iterate the statement or a particular part of the program several times.
-for loop is used when Number of Iterations are fixed


Syntax: 

for(initialization ; condition ; increment/decrement){
	// code
}




initialization:

-The expression represents the initialization of the loop variable.
-We can initialize more than one variable in Expression 1.
-Expression 1 is optional.
-In C, we can not declare the variables in Expression 1. However, It can be an exception in some compilers.


Condition:


-Expression 2 can have more than one condition. However, the loop will iterate until the last condition becomes false. Other conditions will be treated as statements.
-Expression 2 is optional.
-We can pass zero or non-zero value in expression 2. However, in C, any non-zero value is true, and zero is false by default.




increment/decrement:

-Expression 3 is used to update the loop variable.
-We can update more than one variable at the same time.
-Expression 3 is optional.
