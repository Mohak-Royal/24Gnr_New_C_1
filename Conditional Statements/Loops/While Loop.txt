While Loop:

-a while loop allows a part of the code to be executed multiple times depending on the condition. 
- The while loop is mostly used in the case where the number of iterations is not known in advance.
-While loop is also known as pre-tested loop.


Syntax:


while(condition){
	//code
	//increment/decrement can be done here inside the code part
}


Example:

int i = 1;
while(i <= 10){
	printf("%d\n" , i);
}




output:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10


Infinite:


while(1){
	//code
}





-A conditional expression is used to check the condition. The statements defined inside the while loop will repeatedly execute until the given condition fails.
-The condition will be true if it returns 1 or any non-zero. The condition will be false if it return 0.
-In while loop, the condition expression is compulsory.
-Running a while loop without a body is possible.
-We can have more than one conditional expression in while loop.
-If the loop body contains only one statement, then the braces are optional.
